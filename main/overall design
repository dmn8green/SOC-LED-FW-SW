overall design

one task for the repl console

main task
  receives network stack events
  handle state transition based on events
  calls the mqtt loop (or we will have an task polling the api)

one task per led strip to modulate the signal

main
  -> Repl console (uses the MN8App)
  -> MN8App
    -> NetworkManager
      -> Wifi interface
      -> Wifi connection
      -> Eth interface
      -> Eth connection
      -> Event callbacks
      
    -> State Machine
    
    -> LedStripEncoder
